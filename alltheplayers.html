    <h3>Groups and People worth following</h3>
    <p>Aerospace industry pioneers were mostly practitioners starting with none other than the Wright Brothers.
        The tradition is very much alive in the United States with startups in areas such as hypersonics as an example. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>CPS Aerospace Industry : Alwyn Goodloe (NASA Langley Verification Center), NASA IV and V, Anastasia Mavridou, Pierre-Loi Garroche; 
     Look for companies like Vector etc bookmarked that does DO-178 work; Hermeus, Boeing, Airbus (Visakha), Rockwell (Ishan); Georgia Space Initiative (CEO); Museums in DC and Georgia
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>CPS Aerospace Researchers : Eric Feron, Rozier, (these are folks who actually DO stuff)
        </li>        
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>CPS Academics : Platzer, Calin Belta, Richard Murray, Deepak Alur, Sayan Mitra, Chuchu Fan, Ufuk Topku etc and their Labs; Explore Georgia Tech Aerospace, UGA Cubesat groupFundamental books are Huth and Ryan, Gneserth, Jukko Vaananen
