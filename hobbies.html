    <td>Flamenco :</td>
    <td> I started playing Mandoin when I was 5 years old under one of the best Mandolin players of India, Saroj Barua <a href
      ="https://rb.gy/ptma5z">Mandolin clip</a>.
    After moving to USA, I trained under the Mary Akerman <a href="https://rb.gy/edmy07">Recuerdos de al Alhambra</a>, one of the best classical guitarists of the country
    and a GFA Winnder. After attending a concert by the Great Paco De Lucia in a concert, I discovered
    my true calling of the flamenco guitar tradition. The harmonical beauty, rhythmic intricacies and feel
    somehow attracted me to use my backgrounds of everything I learned in Mandolina and Classical Guitar. Learning
    flamenco in USA is not easy as there are only a handful of truly great teachers and I was
    fortunate to find <a href="https://rb.gy/vialh5">Ricardo</a> and his superlative playing at the Maestro level and incredible teaching
    gave me the confidence that it is possible to learn this art</td>

    <td>Drums :</td>
    <td>I love rhythm. In particular, I am trying to learn to play the drum set with the intention of building a repertoire to accompany Reggae and
           solo linear drumming grooves</td>
